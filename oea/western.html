            <h2>Reining Team Announced</h2>
            <img src="images/western_internal.jpeg">
            <h6>DCA Staff February 26, 2015</h6>
            <p>AThrough a rigorous selection process, the team representing Ontario in the upcoming Canadian Equestrian Interprovincial Championships (CEIC May 13 – 15) and held at Stony Mountain Show Jumping, Calgary, Alberta, have been selected.</p>
            <p>The CEIC is a sanctioned Equine Canada bronze competition and a collaborative event between the national and provincial/territorial sport organizations. It aims to develop the next generation of equestrian national and international champions and this year, Alberta is hosting the event.</p>
            <p>The disciplines participating at the CEIC are dressage, jumping and reining – all Equestre Federation International (EFI) sports with both junior and senior participants.</p>
            <p>”We are extremely proud of all our Team Ontario members that worked so hard over the past few months to secure a spot on Team Ontario,” says Lee Maples, Ontario Equestrian Association President, “our selection committee had a difficult time reviewing all of the applications; everyone was very close to qualifying.”</p>
            <p>Back when teenager was jumping, we attended Stony Mountain Show Jumping for the occasional show, and I can tell you it is an incredible venue. It was founded in 1989 by Canadian Equestrian Team member Jane Doe, and just a few minutes south of Calgary, offers world-class facilities. Set against a backdrop of the Stony Mountains, and all foothills and vibes of verdant, it is sure to be a magnificent stage for this prestigious competition.</p>
            <p>While the jumping and dressage events are guaranteed to be an exciting watch, in the western world we’re most interested in the reining. And, most particularly, who made the team!</p>
            <p>The Ontario Equestrian Association has named the following team members.</p>
            <p id="italics">Juniors are: Tony Benji, Hamilton, age 16 and Craig Hibert, Weston, age 14. Senior team members are: Nick Ford, London, age 27 and Jane Hepper, Ottawa, age 53.</p>
            <p id="italics">Ontario Reining Team coach Wendel Clans.</p>
            <p>Reining Coach, Wendel Clans, Waterloo, is an award-winning certified Canada Equine High Performance Reining Coach under the new Canada Equine Competition Coach program and Master Evaluator for the Reining High Performance program. Clans is also an accredited Canada Equine Reining Judge as well as a NHRA judge.</p>
            <p>Chef d’Equipe for Team Ontario is Shannon Crow. Shannon rides both western and english disciplines and has competed in dressage to 3rd Level. She currently rides at King Ridge Farm and was the groom for Jewels Vanderdom at the 2006 World Equestrian Games in Baden Baden, Germany. Shannon hosts and participates in Peter Penman horsemanship clinics, including his ranch clinic in Wyoming every summer. Sharron is a CGA.</p>
            <p id="margin">That’s the Ontario roundup for you, but this event isn’t just about Ontario. Who made the team in your province? Let us know in the comment section below and good luck to all of the competitors!</p>
